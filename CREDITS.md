### All credits go to [Prof. Ron Artstein](http://ron.artstein.org) for putting this problem statement together and providing curated datasets.

**Other credits:-**

The corpus has been adapted from the English (Original) and Chinese (GSD) sections of the universal dependencies corpus. 

The source corpora, documentation, and credits can be found [here](https://universaldependencies.org)

Adaptations include:

- The corpus contains only tokens and original parts of speech.
- In the Chinese corpus, the tag / was replaced with SLASH.
- The format has been changed to the word/TAG format, with each sentence on a separate line. The 'raw' files contain the words only.

Adaptations were made by Ron Artstein, artstein@ict.usc.edu
